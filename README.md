3 core steps to completing app:

1.  store user data:
  Actively keep track of where users are throughout the festival and how long they stay at each artistâ€™s stage.
		this might look like
		Kanye West : 30
		Kendrick Lamar : 20

2. Based on how long each artist is listed by a user, a list of artists in priority is made.

    1. Kanye West
    2.Kendrick Lamar
    
3.
Each one of these artists has the following information scraped about them to generate a follow-up report 


*set lists, which create a spotify playlist (data scraped from setlist.fm)
*Upcoming shows: SongKick API
  --> incorporate uber to shows, reminds you x minutes before doors open
*New Merch: Bandpage
